                    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

                    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

                    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
                    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

                    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
                    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
                    as of the date such litigation is filed.

                    meet the following conditions:
                </p>
                <p>
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                    stating that You changed the files; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                    the Derivative Works; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

                    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
                    the conditions stated in this License.

                    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

                    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

                <p>
                    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
